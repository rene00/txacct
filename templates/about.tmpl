  <p>Hello, my name is Rene.</p>

  <p>I'm facinated with personal finance, especially the
  analytical side of things.</p>

  <p>For a while, I've been thinking about the type of meta data that bank transactions
  contain as well as the derived data that could be generated from them. I'm
  curious to see what kind of value that this kind of data could uncover if made
  available to users.</p>

  <p>In 2023, I started building Transaction Search to try and bring some of
  my ideas into reality.</p>
